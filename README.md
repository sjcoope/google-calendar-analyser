# Troubleshooting

**Permission denied when running batch file**
If you get a "permission denied" error when trying to run the batch file that builds the help file then run this command in the terminal `chmod u+x script.sh`

# TODO

- Automate build of help dialog.
- Setup Clasp Run as per these instructions - https://github.com/google/clasp/blob/master/docs/run.md
- Add getting started to help dialog (capture first steps, settings, etc.)
- Remove complexity tooling
- Add tslinting
- Set-up scanning in sonarcloud
